## Abstract

Today, daily life is composed of many computing systems, therefore interacting with them in a natural way makes the communication process more comfortable. Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) has been developed to overcome the communication barriers between humans and
computers. One form of HCI is Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR), which predicts the class and the instant of execution of a given movement of the hand. One possible input for these models is surface electromyography (EMG), which records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. EMG signals contain information about the intention of movement generated by the human brain. This systematic literature review analyses the state-of-the-art of real-time hand gesture recognition models using EMG data and machine learning. We selected and assessed 65 primary studies following the Kitchenham methodology. Based on a common structure of machine learning-based systems, we analyzed
the structure of the proposed models and standardized concepts in regard to the types of models, data acquisition, segmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, postprocessing, real-time processing, types of gestures, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we also identified trends and gaps that could open new directions of work for future research in the area of gesture recognition using EMG.
